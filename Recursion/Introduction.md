recursion
nounMATHEMATICSâ€¢LINGUISTICS
the repeated application of a recursive procedure or definition.

**What is Recursion ?**
The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function. 
Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. 
Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), Inorder/Preorder/Postorder Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.

**How a particular problem is solved using recursion ?**
The idea is to represent a problem in terms of one or more smaller problems, 
and add one or more base conditions that stop the recursion. 
For example, we compute factorial n if we know factorial of (n-1). The base case for factorial would be n = 0. We return 1 when n = 0.

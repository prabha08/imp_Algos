## Problems
- [ ] **Problem 1: Power of a number**  
      Write a program to find x to the power n (i.e. x^n). Take x and n from the user. You need to return the answer.
      
- [ ] **Problem 2 : Number of Digits in a number**   
      Write the code to find out and return the number of digits present in a number recursively. 
      
- [ ] **Problem 3 : Sum of Array**  
      Given an array of length N, you need to find and return the sum of all elements of the array.
      
- [ ] **Problem 4 : First index of a number**  
      Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the first index of integer x present in the array. Return -1       if it is not present in the array. First index means, the index of first occurrence of x in the input array.
      Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.
      
- [ ] **Problem 5 : Last index of a number**  
      Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the last index of integer x present in the array. Return -1       if it is not present in the array. Last index means - if x is present multiple times in the array, return the index at which x comes       last in the array. You should start traversing your array from 0, not from (N - 1).
      Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.
      
- [ ] **Problem 6 : All indices of a number**  
      [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/recursive-program-to-find-all-indices-of-a-number/]  
      Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find all the indexes where x is present in the input array. Save all the           indexes in an array (in increasing order).
      Do this recursively. Indexing in the array starts from 0.

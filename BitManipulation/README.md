# Questions

- [ ] **Problem 1 : Set i'th bit**   
      You are given two integers N and i. You need to make ith bit of binary representation of N to 1 and return the updated N.
Counting of bits start from 0 from right to left.   
- [ ] **Problem 2 : Unset i'th bit**   
      You are given two integers N and i. You need to make ith bit of binary representation of N to 0 and return the updated N.
Counting of bits start from 0 from right to left.   
- [ ] **Problem 3 : Flip i'th bit**   
      Given a number N and i. You need to flip the i'th bit.   
- [ ] **Problem 4 : Check Odd Even**    
      Find if a given number is odd or even.    
- [ ] **Problem 5 : Check Power of 2**   
      Find if a given number is a power of 2.    
- [ ] **Problem 6 : Find first set bit**  
      You are given an integer N. You need to return an integer M, in which only one bit is set which at position of lowest set bit of N (from right to left).   
- [ ] **Problem 7 : Turn off first set bit**  
      You are given an integer Ni. You need to make first set bit of binary representation of N to 0 and return the updated N.
Counting of bits start from 0 from right to left.   
- [ ] **Problem 8 : Clear all bits from MSB to i'th bit**   
      You are given two integers N and i. You need to clear all bits from MSB to ith bit (start i from right to left) and return the updated N.
Counting of bits starts from 0 from right to left.    
- [ ] **Problem 9 : Clear all bits from LSB to i'th bit**   
You are given two integers N and i. You need to clear all bits from LSB to ith bit (start i from right to left) and return the updated N.
Counting of bits starts from 0 from right to left.

- [ ] **Problem 5 : Bottom**   (may leave this ques)    
      A node v in a graph G=(V,E) is called a sink, if for every node w in G that is reachable from v, v is also reachable from w. The bottom of a graph is the subset of all nodes that are sinks, i.e., bottom(G)={v∈V∣∀w∈V:(v→w)⇒(w→v)}. You have to calculate the bottom of certain graphs.
